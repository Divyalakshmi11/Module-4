# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## 🧾 Program
~~~
import math

class cse:
    def mech(self, radius):
        area = math.pi * radius ** 2
        print("Area of the circle:", area)

radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
obj = cse()
obj.mech(radius)
~~~

## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## 🧾 Program

~~~
def merge(dict1, dict2):
    merged = {**dict1, **dict2}
    return merged

dict1 = {'a': 10, 'b': 20}
dict2 = {'b': 30, 'c': 40}

result = merge(dict1, dict2)
print("Merged dictionary:", result)
~~~
## Output

## Result
The program successfully merges two dictionaries, combining all key-value pairs. If a key exists in both, the value from the second dictionary overwrites the first.

## Result
The program successfully calculates the area of a circle for any radius entered by the user using a class and method.
